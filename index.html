            <h3>custom calculator tool </h3>
            <p>During my internship, I developed a custom calculator application designed to perform a variety of arithmetic and scientific calculations 
                with precision and efficiency. This calculator features a user-friendly interface, including a clear display and responsive buttons for
                basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it incorporates advanced functionalities 
                like trigonometric functions, exponentiation, and logarithms. The application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a seamless 
                user experience across different devices. This project honed my skills in web development, problem-solving, and algorithmic logic, and 
                demonstrated my ability to deliver functional and polished software solutions.
